# CTF_Capstone_Iran-SeekandHide
Detective: Looks like we can use steghide on these pictures... but what are the passwords?? do these pictures mean anything to you?

The only thing that the master-mind criminal, Ralph, has left behind before his passing was this zipped file. His final words were 'You now have all you need to find my last flag... the flag that you find will grant you access to my secret hideout'. Please Help the investigation team find this flag!
Picture in the zip file represent something or have a meaning to them. 
I reverse engineered the images to find clues to what the pictures are hiding.
Turns out that they are logo brands for games and consoles. 
After figuring out what the hidden text is for each picture, I ran them in an online steghide
to get the hidden message.
